								<p>Web3 Primer</p>
								<br>
								<p>Enabling the creation and exchange of value without 
									reliance on a central authority, blockchain 
									technology has engendered the formation of new 
									digital communities and inspired artists and others to 
									experiment with the technology in novel ways. 
									Concurrent with the proliferation of this still nascent 
									innovation, new terms have emerged that are related 
									to or dependent on the blockchain, including Web3.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Our aspiration in this Web3 primer is to begin to 
									demystify some of the jargon behind these 
									foundational concepts so that it can serve as an 
									entry point into further exploration and inquiry.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>Rather than an endpoint, we hope this is the 
									beginning of the journey for many as we collectively 
									try and shape the use of the underlying technology 
									in positive ways.

								<h2>Web3</h2>
								<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
								<p>A concept referring to the next iteration of the World 
									Wide Web, the fundamental infrastructure of which 
									relies on blockchain technology. The ethos of Web3 
									is to create a more equitable and decentralized 
									system that empowers users with ownership over 
									their online interactions and their data. A loosely 
									defined and evolving term, Web3 encompasses 
									NFTs, the metaverse, and DeFi, among other 
									domains.</p>

								<h2>Blockchain</h2>
								<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
								<p>A computer system that runs across many 
									traditional computers and is protected by 
									cryptography. Blockchains reliably and securely 
									execute programs, known as smart contracts, 
									without the need for trusting any one particular 
									remote computer.</p>

								<h2>Metaverse</h2>
								<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
								<p>Online, multidimensional universe that can

									groups as well as their identities, holdings, and 
									transactional systems within a larger and expanding 
									ecosystem whose reliability, in part, is supported by 
									the blockchain.

								<h2>Token</h2>

								<h2>Web3 or</h2>
								<h2>Crypto Wallet</h2>
								<p>A device or software program for transacting with 
									blockchains. Wallets enable one to create, buy, trade 
									and securely access digital assets. Web3 wallets act 
									as an entry point into DeFi (Decentralized Finance) 
									and NFT applications, among other uses.

								<h2>Digital Art</h2>
								<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
								<p>Artworks that utilize digital technology in some form. 
									While artists have been working with computer 
									technology since the 1950’s, Digital art was 
									popularized as a term in the 1980’s with the rise of 
									personal computing.</p>
