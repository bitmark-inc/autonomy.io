						<h2>Web3</h2>
						<p>Web3 is a concept referring to the next iteration of the internet, the fundamental infrastructure of
							which relies on blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks. The ethos of Web3 is to create a more
							equitable and decentralized system that empowers users with ownership over their online interactions and
							their data. A loosely defined and evolving term, Web3 encompasses NFTs, the metaverse, and DeFi, among
							other domains.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item bg-pink">
				<div class="item-inner">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Blockchain</h2>
						<p>A publicly-accessible digital ledger used to store and transfer information without the need for a
							central authority. Blockchains are the core technology on which the Web3 ecosystem relies.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item bg-pink-light">
				<div class="item-inner">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Decentralized</h2>
						<p>Blockchain technology ensures decentralization, meaning there is no primary governing figure or
							authority; rather, all interactions and operations are performed as a part of a distributed peer-to-peer
							network.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item bg-orange">
				<div class="item-inner">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Metaverse</h2>
						<p>A theoretical and emergent concept for a “virtual world” that enables people to interact as they would in
							the physical world, accessed through digital interfaces such as mobile devices, computers and VR headsets.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item bg-yellow ">
				<div class="item-inner">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Non-Fungible
							Token (NFT)</h2>
						<p>A unit that is totally unique as a digital asset that is certified on a digital ledger, or blockchain. An
							NFT can’t be exchanged with a like entity (the way one dollar bill is equivalent to another), so it can be
							used to digitally codify ownership of entities including art.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item bg-yellow-light">
				<div class="item-inner">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Fungible Token</h2>
						<p>A representation of a digital asset on the blockchain that is non-unique and can be traded or exchanged
							for another e.g. cryptocurrency.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item bg-green">
				<div class="item-inner">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Web3 Wallet</h2>
						<p>A digital wallet enables one to buy, trade and securely store digital assets, including non-fungible
							tokens and fungible tokens. Web3 wallets also act as one’s entry point into the larger DeFi and Web3
							ecosystem, as one often needs a wallet to access Web3 applications.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item bg-cyan-light">
				<div class="item-inner">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Smart Contract</h2>
						<p>Self-executing code written into the blockchain that automates the execution of an agreement between two
							parties. Smart contracts enable NFTs to be sold and traded on the blockchain.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item bg-cyan">
				<div class="item-inner">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Generative Art</h2>
						<p>Art that is created in part or in whole with the use of an autonomous system or computer code and often
							relies on elements of randomness or chance e.g. Refik Anadol’s Unsupervised - Machine Hallucinations -
							MoMA.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item bg-blue">
				<div class="item-inner">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>On-Chain Art</h2>
						<p>A term referring to NFTs that “live” on the blockchain; in other words, both the smart contract tied to
							the NFT and the media content of the NFT (“the art”) is written into the blockchain. Most NFT’s are still
							stored off-chain.</p>
