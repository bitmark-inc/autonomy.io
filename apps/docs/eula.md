4. Premium Feature(s) and Subscriptions

   You may purchase access to premium features available in or through the Software (“Premium Feature(s)”). If you purchase an auto-renewing periodic subscription to Premium Feature(s) through the Software, your account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you terminate it as set forth below. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to follow the instructions provided in the Software to terminate or change your subscription, even if you have deleted your account.

   We may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Premium Feature(s) at any time, with or without notice. We may revise the pricing for the Software and Premium Feature(s) at any time. We shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that we exercise any such rights.

   You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using the copy of the Software installed on your device. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase, transaction, or other monetary interaction with the Software must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will pay any applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such purchases, transactions or other monetary transaction interactions.

   All payments are nonrefundable. There are no refunds or credits for Premium Feature(s) or partially used subscription periods. However, we may grant refunds or credits on a case-by-case basis at our sole discretion. Our grant of a refund or credit in one instance does not obligate us to provide a refund or credit in the future, under any circumstances. If you cancel your periodic subscription to Premium Feature(s), you will continue to have access to the Premium Feature(s) through the end of your current billing period.

   All financial transactions made in connection with the Software will be processed by a third party in accordance with their respective terms of use, privacy policy, and/or any applicable payment terms and conditions. We encourage you to learn about the practices of such third party. In no event will we be responsible for the actions or inactions of any third party payment processor, including, but not limited to, system downtime or payment service outages.

5. Termination. This Agreement is effective until terminated. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of the Software in your possession or control. We strongly recommend that you cancel your subscription to any Premium Feature(s) before doing so. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from us if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination you must destroy all copies of the Software in your possession or control.
